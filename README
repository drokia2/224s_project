####WORKFLOW FOR GETTING SOUNDS #######

to test if it works add your FWA's name in the FWOA.txt ( yes this is the
file for friends without accents but just put it temporarily at the top
of the file) and run 'sudo python align_all.py'  and make sure that the first 
couple of so ( assuming u added it to the top of the file ) and it will tell you which
one it has an error in.

============

Work has been done to categorize and classify accents, but mainly with the intent to model accents to enable more robust speech recognizers. Our goal was to build a technology that can pinpoint mistakes and variations in pronunciation that can be used to identify problem areas in foreign speakers. The system we have created uses the Penn Forced Aligner and comparisons between native and foreign speech to successfully identify these problem areas.
